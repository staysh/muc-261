## Course Description

Introduces representation of data in visual and sonic forms. Surveys data visualization techniques, from charts in spreadsheet software to interactive, abstract, and experimental new media. Examines the role of sound as a means of processing and representing information. Provides hands-on experience using modern tools and techniques to manipulate and process data sets into audiovisual representations. Prerequisites: (WR 115 and RD 115) or IRW 115 and MTH 20 or equivalent placement. Audit available.

## Required Materials

- computer and internet connection
- [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) account
- [Observable](https://observablehq.com) account
- Additional free, open-source software or services may be required as needed

## Recommended Materials

- CoCalc course fee ($14) *see note below*
- *OR* Local installation and management of Python (3.x), Jupyter and related packages
- You are welcome to use any supplemental software

### CoCalc

CoCalc is a hosted Jupyter Notebook environment with many helpful features for working with data both individually and collaboratively. It is free to make an account, but the features and speed are extremely limited, the small course fee ($14) will enable a much more pleasant experience. Alternatively, you can keep the free account for collaboration access to notebooks and maintain your own local installation of Python, Jupyter and related packages.

## Major Assignments and Due Dates:

The course is primarily composed of two week modules, with the exception being the first and the last module are three weeks in duration. The modules culminate in the completion and presentation of the assignments titled below. More information on the individual assignments will be provided separately.

### Presentation Topics and Session Dates

- Lie Factor : Thursday, October 14th
- Iterations on Visualization : Thursday, October 28th
- Event Based Sonification : Thursday, November 11th
- Audification & Parameterization : Thursday, November 25th
- Final Project : Tuesday, December 14th *see note below on additional timelines*

---

## Grading Criteria

Projects will be graded on a scale of 1-5 on the following criteria:

- improving coherence/reveal of data (1 pt)
- avoiding distortion of data (1 pt) 
- clarity of process and intent (0.5 pt)
- creativity, aesthetic execution (0.5 pt)
- personal evaluation of your own work (1 pt)

### Additional Timelines for Final Project

The final project will require significant preparation to find and clean data as well as iterate on display methods. Some rough dates to adhere to are:

- Weeks 1 - 3 : Finding the data you'd like to work with
- Weeks 4 - 6 : Processing that data to import for display
- Weeks 7 - 9 : Iterating on display ideas

### Course Grades

Your grade in the course will be a weighted average of your project grades:
- weights greater than 1 may be applied to projects that show exemplary growth 
- weights less than 1 may be applied to anomalously low scores

## Notes on the Course Approach and Flow

Each session per week will be almost entirely devoted to one of to areas: working with data, or data displays (Visual/Audio):

|	| Tuesday | Thursday |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Focus | Data Processing | Data Display |
|Environment | CoCalc/Jupyter | D3 / Observable |
| Language | Python | Javascript / tbd |

*Note: Sonification tools are tbd*

## A Note About Coding:

There are no 'fixed' prerequisites for this course, only recommendations. Previous experience coding is not necessary for success in this course. What is necessary is a willingness to write, hack, copy, paste, or otherwise create and/or manipulate code. We will be using "textual programming instructions" (aka code) nearly every course meeting.

---

## Course Text

There are required readings each week for the first seven weeks. The readings are selected from the following texts. (PDFs  are available)

- *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* by Edward Tufte  
- *The Sonification Handbook* by Thomas Hermann; Andy Hunt; John G Neuhoff

### Social Reading Option

A non-mandatory and experimental website is available to read/write real-time comments on the course texts shared with the whole class in a web browser. This is self-hosted and there are no guarantees on functionality or security.

---

## Attendance Policy

Attendance to sessions is vital to success in the course. If you have difficulties attending sessions, notes or recordings may be available depending on presence of support staff. Reasonable effort will be made to support "asynchronicities"

## Make-Ups / Late Work

Presentations are only accepted during presentation sessions. Please submit any late work directly to D2L (or email). Material review can be scheduled during office hours (if available).

## Flexibility 
The instructor reserves the right to modify course
content and/or substitute assignments and learning activities in
response to institutional, weather, or class situations.
